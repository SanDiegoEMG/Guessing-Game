# Psychic-Game
My first game: try to guess the letter chosen by computer

*hint: the letter console logs so you can play with all the functionality*

Javascript and JQuery: first time seeing some of the functionality: .hide(), .show(), onKeyUp, onDocumentStart, etc ...

Materialize: first time using this instead of Bootstrap. Similar. I like the way Materialize does colors.
